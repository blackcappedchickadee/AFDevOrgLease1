# AFDevOrgLease1
Renews the "lease" on an Agentforce enabled dev org. Uses a Github Action

I drew inspiration from this post: https://bobbuzzard.blogspot.com/2025/03/keep-your-agentforce-dev-org-alive-and.html

See related repo which contains the .github/workflows/renew.yaml - which itself will run every Monday at 20:30 hrs.
